        I am Software Engineer who is passionate about creating engaging apps, games and Virtual
        Reality experiences. I have a background in both software engineering and music
        technology. My interest in coding started when I developed a few virtual synthesizers
        while studying music technology. I found it surprisingly enjoyable and decided to pursue
        it further by studying Computer Science masters at Nottingham University.
      </p>

      <p className="paragraph">
        During my studies, I had the opportunity to take courses in game development and mixed
        reality, where I discovered my interest in creating 3D projects using Unity3D. Since then,
        I have been honing my skills and exploring the possibilities of interactive 3D
        applications, virtual reality simulations, and video games.
      </p>

      <p className="paragraph">
        In addition, I'm interested in expanding my knowledge of other coding practices, such as
        React, and front-end development for websites. Ultimately, I hope to continue growing as a
        developer and to share my passion for software engineering with others.
