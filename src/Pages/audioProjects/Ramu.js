        About The Project
      </h3>

      <p className='paragraph1'>
        "Ramu" is a song originally written and performed by Kazimieras Lik≈°a, whose alternative
        rock and acoustic style resonated deeply with me. I felt compelled to create a cover of this
        song, which would be a homage to his work while incorporating my own musical tastes.
      </p>

      <p className='paragraph1'>
        To achieve this, I aimed to imbue the track with a cinematic sound, distinct from the
        original. With only my acoustic guitar and voice at my disposal, I turned to virtual
        instruments from 8DIO and Spitfire Audio, which added a magical touch to the music.
      </p>

      <p className='paragraph1'>
        To complement the audio, I sought to create a visual representation of the song and enlisted
        the help of my friend Chris Fernandez, a talented video director and editor. He worked his
        magic and filmed and edited the video that you can watch at the beginning of the page. I
        highly recommend following his <a
